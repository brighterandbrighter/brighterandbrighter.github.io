          <li>Get peer feedback - what specific areas could I do differently?</li>
          <li>Record yourself - awkward, but can be helpful for gaining perspective</li>
          <li>Imagine the conversation - envision different questions that might come up in a meeting, and write yourself some social scripts 
          <li>Keep track of what went well - when did you succeed socially? What did you do? Celebrate this, you can learn from it!</li>
          <li>Focus on key points - you don’t need to script every word. Focusing on an outline of what you want the person to understand frees you up to communicate it in a way that feels right to you.</li> 
          <li>Pay attention to environmental factors - does a quieter or busier space help with answering the phone? Do headphones help/hinder?</li> 
          <li>Take notes - knowing you won’t forget something important can help with feeling less stressed.</li> 
          <li>Use sensory grounding techniques - fidget toys or worry stones - to help regulate your emotions before a difficult meeting or call.</li> 
          <li>Ask to pause to think - “Can I think for a second?” “I find it hard to think on the spot. Can I pause this conversation and get back to you?”</li>
          <li>Plan for difficult situations - Communicate openly with your colleagues or manager about what you need and come up with a plan to handle difficult situations, like a signal that means “I need extra time to think”.</li>
          <li>Check your understanding - when responding to someone, say “can I check I’ve understood you fully?” and summarise your understanding of what they’ve said.</li>
          <li>Tap out the syllables of what you want to say until there’s a pause in the conversation - movement can help with working memory. </li>
          <li>Grounding - focus on physical sensations like your feet on the floor to stay feeling anchored and present.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>If you want to speed up your reading, practise scanning a text to answer a specific question you have about it, rather than looking to understand every detail.</li>
          <li>If you tend to skim-read, practise deliberately slowing yourself down by increasing the size of text on your screen, covering up most of the page, or printing the document and highlighting as you go.</li>
          <li>Think about what senses distract you the most when proofreading, and modify your environment to adjust for this. Can you experiment with doing a proofreading task in a quieter space? Wearing headphones? What changes for you?</li>
          <li>Use speech to text to read your own writing back to you (it's built into a lot of modern devices). You might find you are able to pick up errors listening back which you weren't able to spot before.</li>
          <li>Experiment with adjusting screen settings like font size and typeface, dark mode and light mode, to see what feels easiest on your eyes. Try a different setup for a few hours or a whole day, then try a different one, and see how your work changes.</li>
          <li>Try changing how your writing looks - handwrite instead of typing, use a different colour for font or paper, change the size of the page or the spatial layout to make it more interesting and increase focus.</li>
          <li>Do you prefer to think about ideas one at a time, or do you prefer to look at the "big picture"? If a document you're working on has too many ideas at once on it and you need to progress through one by one, try covering up or sectioning off the part you're working on. If you'd rather think about the whole picture, take a pause to think about the purpose of, and perhaps read through, the whole document you're working on before you start writing anything.</li>
          <li>Create a checklist of your most common errors (this might be something you need to do over a period of time). Do you have trouble with words that sound like each other? With punctuation? With adding syllables? With past/present tense? Giving yourself a list of things to look for gives you a more specific set of tasks to approach the problem.</li>
          <li>Set expectations. If you need extra time to proofread, ask for it with plenty of time to spare - let the person know that you're looking to give them the best material possible.</li>
          <li>Know when to delegate! If you have a colleague who's a particularly strong reader, find out if you can share the final stage of proofreading with them.</li>
          <li>If typing or writing is difficult, think about how you could try out different kinds of physical support - proprioception (your sense of where you are in space) can change the experience of writing for some people. You could try sitting in a different type of chair, planting your feet on the floor, sitting cross legged or kneeling, or wearing clothes with some compression to slightly support your joints - see if this makes even a slight difference to the experience of typing or writing.</li>
          <li>Build rewards into the process of difficult tasks rather than saving them for afterwards - listen to music you love, get some delicious snacks, or alternate paragraphs with a micro-break to do something genuinely fun.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Connect numbers to real-world events. If you're looking at a percentage, how many real people is that using a product or system? What might their lives be like? How might using this change things for them?</li>
          <li>Build rewards into the process of difficult tasks rather than saving them for afterwards - listen to music you love, get some delicious snacks, or alternate calculations with a micro-break to do something genuinely fun.</li>
          <li>Use a piece of paper or some clay to make maths like fractions and percentages make more sense. See if this makes a difference to how you work.</li>
          <li>Make quick guides for numerical tasks you have to do over and over. Write them down, and put them somewhere near your workspace that you can see easily.</li>
          <li>Use props! There is no shame in using a calculator, or just typing the problem into Google (which has a great calculator built into the search bar). Life is hard enough - if it helps, use it.</li>
          <li>Regularly practising mental maths can be helpful. Duolingo has a maths curriculum! Commit to an amount of regular practice that feels manageable, even if it seems small. How long a time window could you guarantee you'd always be able to commit to?</li>
          <li>Explain charts and graphs to someone else and see if the act of teaching improves your understanding or helps you to spot things you've missed.</li>
          <li>Studies of identity suggest that believing you are bad at maths (rather unhelpfully) reduces maths performance. Every time you successfully do a numerical task, log that somewhere. Come back to this log regularly and sit with how it feels to have a record of your success.</li>
          <li>Consider your senses. Do you have access to a quieter space or to a space with more natural light? Try using it and see if it makes a difference to your ability to process.</li>
           <li>Ask colleagues or friends who are comfortable with numbers how they would approach a problem. See if their explanation helps you find a new way to approach it.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Make sure you are well resourced before you start a physical task. Have you eaten and drunk water? Are you overtired? Planning more challenging tasks for times of day when you are better resourced may help at least a little.</li>
          <li>Make sure your clothes and shoes are comfortable and give you good feedback. Shoes that make a sound when you take a step can be distracting for some but can give others useful information about where you are in space.</li>
          <li>Consider your environment. Is anything out of place? If so, could you potentially knock it over or trip over it? Set aside some time to audit your environment and move things out of the way that might cause trouble.</li>
          <li>Related to the above point - ask colleagues (or household members if you work from home) to join in with decluttering the environment so that you can all move around more easily and safely.</li>
          <li>As you move around, use a torch and point it potential obstacles as you move around. This will focus your vision on possible obstacles and should reduce the risk of bumping into things.</li>
          <li>Are there points in your day where you could reduce walking around? How much movement is actually needed? Could some things be done more efficiently? Could you have a conversation with your manager about this?</li>
          <li>If you need to slow down in busy places, it might be necessary to speak to your colleagues about this. Practise saying things like "I need to slow down a bit to make sure I get this right", or "Can you hold on for a moment? I need to concentrate", or "Can you hold that thought until we've got to where we're going? I want to make sure I can listen to you properly". You don't need to overexplain unless you want to and feel safe to.<li>
          <li>Touch objects in your environment to give your brain a little extra feedback on where you are in space.</li>
          <li>Visualise movements you need to make ahead of time. Picture yourself completing the task as vividly as you can. This can improve performance in physical tasks - your muscle fibres are firing to some extent even when you are only imagining using them!</li>
