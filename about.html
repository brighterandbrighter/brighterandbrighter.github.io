                              <h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>To start with, I think it's important for all my clients to know that I'm diagnosed with ADHD (and ASD) myself. I was diagnosed in my late twenties, after a lifetime of not understanding why I couldn't <i>just do things</i> other people seemed to find easy. I know what it's like to struggle, and to feel like your brain is your enemy.</p>
				    
				    <p>I also know that when we really understand our unique ADHD brains, and <strong>learn to work with them rather than against them</strong>, leaning on our strengths, rather than punishing ourselves for not living up to what we've been told we "should" be...well, it changes absolutely everything. ADHD coaching is one way to get there.</p>
				    
				    <p>I've worked in academia (I have a PhD about ukulele players...), in tech, and as an artist and touring musician. I've harnessed my brain to do a lot of awesome things. You can too. Let's figure it out together.</p>
				    
				    <br/><br/><h2>About ADHD/Executive Function Coaching</h2>
				    <p>Coaching is not therapy. We don't spend a lot of time talking about the past, or trying to fix or heal you - <strong>we start with your strengths</strong>, and work from the assumption you're not broken to begin with. <strong>Our focus is on the present and future - on your goals, what you want out of life, and the real-world actions you can take to get there.</strong> In coaching, we are always in forward motion, but that forward motion might be a fairly straight line, or a more winding road. It's different for everyone.</p>
				    
				    <p>Coaching is a collaboration between coach and client. You might think of an ADHD coach as a conversation partner with a deep understanding of your unique brain wiring. We focus on learning to work with, rather than against, your ADHD traits. This might look like figuring out tools and systems that really work for you (rather than the ones you've been told <i>should</i> work, but don't), getting clearer on what you really want out of your work, life, or relationships and the steps you'll need to take to get there, or working out the answers to more practical everyday questions like "how do I make feeding myself/getting to bed earlier/tidying up easier than it is right now?".</p> 
					    <p>You steer the session - I never give one-size-fits-all solutions. But I will help you think through what could work for <i>you</i>, and help you figure out how to actually implement it.</p>
				
				    <p>You do <strong>not</strong> need a formal diagnosis of ADHD to benefit from ADHD coaching. Whether you're formally diagnosed/self-diagnosed/think you might have traits of ADHD but aren't really sure/are otherwise neurodivergent/find executive functioning challenging for some other reason, if you believe you might benefit from coaching designed for ADHD brains, you are also absolutely welcome here.</p>

				    <h2>About Sessions/Fees</h2>
                              <p>
                    I've been in training at <a href="https://addca.com/adhd-coach-training/ADD-Coach-Academy/ADDCA">ADDCA</a> in the USA since 2022, and am now seeing clients as I work towards accreditation with the ICF and PAAC. I am based in the UK, in a leafy part of Berkshire, England, but I love working with clients from all over the world. Sessions are held on Zoom.</p> 

                             
                              <p>While I'm still a trainee, my standard rate is <strong>£20 for a 30-minute session</strong>, or <strong>£40 for a 60-minute session</strong>. Some people find they get more out of shorter sessions, and some people prefer to have a full hour to explore. If booked in blocks of 4 weeks, I offer a 10% discount.</p>

				    <p>I do also keep some <strong>low-cost coaching slots</strong> open each week at a fixed rate of <strong>£5</strong>, on a no-questions-asked basis, for people who can't afford my full fee for any reason. 
					    <p>I'm also happy to discuss options for <strong>pay-what-you-can rates, or barter/skill-exchange</strong>.</p>
                            	</p>

                                    We usually start with a free 30-minute initial consultation call, so we can get to know each other and figure out whether working together would be a good fit. Email me at <a href="mailto:hi@brighteradhd.com">hi@brighteradhd.com</a> if you'd like to book one of these.
