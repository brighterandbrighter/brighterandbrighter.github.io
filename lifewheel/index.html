    <h1>The Life Wheel</h1>
    <p>The Life Wheel exercise gives us a way to get a snapshot of your life as you see it today. <strong>Think about each section of the wheel as it relates to your life. How satisfied are you with that section right now?</strong></p>
    <p>Define each area by what it means to you.</p>

      <h1>Questions we might ask:</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>How did you select the specific area of your life for each section of the life wheel?</li>

<li>What is your specific definition
for each of the life wheel
categories? For example, what
does emotional or financial
mean to you? (Your definition
is the only right one, but it is
important that you know what
you mean.)</li>

<li>What did the number in each
section reveal to you?
How did you determine your
level of satisfaction for each of
your categories? (For example,
how do you know that Physical
was a 6?)</li>

<li>What did you say to
yourself after completing
the life wheel?</li>

<li>If you were to select one or
two sections to improve upon,
what would they be and why?</li>

<li>If you were to improve a
section by one number or level,
what would that look like?</li>

<li>What would it take to bring
a section up one number or level?</li>
</ul>

<section><h3>Levels 1-3</h3>
<p>There is plenty that I wish to change. I might be actively working on this but bigger factors are getting in the way, I am stuck, or I might be making a minimal effort because this area is not presently a priority.</p></section>

<section>
  <h3>Levels 3-5</h3>
<p>I have have reached a somewhat satisfying midpoint. This might be through circumstance or a moderate degree of effort. I wish to gain clarity in this area through further exploration to achieve a higher level of satisfaction.</p></section>

<section><h3>Levels 6-7</h3>
  <p>I have reached a comfortable midpoint midpoint and am fairly satisfied with this area of my life. I might still wish to enquire and explore to further develop my satisfaction, however.</p>
</section>

<section><h3>Levels 8-9</h3>
  <p>I might have become actively inspired or excited by elements of this category, and have chosen to direct more effort and energy towards it to match my new standards and values.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h3>Level 10</h3>
  <p>I feel I am truly my authentic self in this area, and living my life with high integrity. I am very satisfied.</p>
